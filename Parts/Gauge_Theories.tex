\subsection{Quantisation in the Presence of Local Symmetries}

Recall that our chosen approach to the quantisation of (local) Lagrangian field theories deals with expressions of the form
$$ \langle O_1 ... O_n \rangle := \frac{1}{Z} \int_\FF e^{i/\hbar S(\phi)} O_1(\phi) ... O_n(\phi) D\phi $$
where $S = \int_M L$, the Lagrangian $L$ is a local $(0,top)$-form and $\FF = \Gamma(M, F)$. Further the $O_i$ are local action functionals on $\FF$ and we define
$$ \ZF := \int_\FF e^{i/\hbar S(\phi)} D\phi $$
where $D\phi$ is supposed to be "a measure" on $\FF$ which \textbf{does not exists in general}. Now for \textbf{finite dimensions}, given a measure $\mu$ on $X$ we have the \textbf{Stationary Phase Formula}
\begin{align}\label{eq:StatPhase}\tag{SPF}
  \ZF := \int_X \mu e^{i/\hbar S_0} \ \underset{\hbar \lra 0}{\sim} \ &\left[ \sum_{x_0 \in Crit(S_0)} e^{i/\hbar S(x_0)} \left|\det\HH[S](x_0)\right|^{-1/2} \exp\left(i \frac{\pi}{4} \sgn(S(x_0))\right) \right]\\
   &\cdot (2\pi \hbar)^{\dim(X)/2} \sum_{\gamma \ graph} \frac{\hbar^{-g(\gamma)}}{|\Aut(\gamma)|} \Phi_\gamma
\end{align}
Where $\gamma$ are \emph{Feynman graphs}, $g(\gamma)$ is the genus of $\gamma$ and $\Phi(\gamma)$ is the weight of a graph. Note that here we have an \emph{implicit assumption}, namely that $\HH[S](x_0)$ is non-degenerate. In field theory, we use the stationary phase formula as a \emph{definition} of the "path integral".\\

Now we can ask ourselves, if the possible degeneracy of $\HH[S](x_0)$ really is an issue. The answer is: \textbf{Yes!} Consider $\FF = \Gamma(M, F)$ with $M$ closed without boundary. Let further $S = \int_M L$. Now assume we are given a collection $\{V_\alpha\}^M$ of local symmetries \ref{def:LocalSymmetry} such that
$$ \lie{V_\alpha} S = V_\alpha^{(i)} \frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi^{(i)}} = 0 $$
Namely we obtain the \emph{Noether Identities}. Now consider
\begin{align}
  0 = \frac{\delta}{\delta \phi^{(j)}} \left( V_\alpha^{(i)} \frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi^{(i)}} \right) = \HH[S]_{(ij)} V^{(i)}_\alpha + \frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi^{(i)}} \frac{\delta V_\alpha^i}{\delta \phi^{(j)}}
\end{align}
Thus we restrict to $x_0 \in Crit(S) = \{x \in \FF \ s.t. \ \delta S|_x = 0\}$ such that
$$ \HH[S]_{(ij)}(x_0) V^{(i)}_\alpha = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad V_\alpha \ \text{is a local symmetry} $$

\begin{ex}
  Show that $\{V_\alpha \in \VF_{evol}(\FF)\}$ which are local symmetries of $S$ forms a Lie subalgebra of $\VF_{evol}(\FF)$. We further denote it by $\widetilde{\gf}$.
\end{ex}

Note that not all symmetries are "interesting" and thus not all symmetries are created equal. Consider a bivectorfield $\mu \in \Gamma(\bigwedge^2 (T\FF))$ and look at the vector field
$$ \omega := \mu(\delta S), \quad \mu = \mu^{ij} \frac{\delta}{\delta \phi^{(i)}} \wedge \frac{\delta}{\delta \phi^{(j)}}, \quad \omega = \mu^{ij} \frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi^{(i)}} \frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi^{(j)}}, \quad \mu^{ij} = - \mu^{ji} $$
Now we claim that $\omega$ is a local symmetry $\forall \mu$:

\begin{proof}
  $\lie{\omega} S = \frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi^{(i)}} \omega^i = \frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi^{(i)}} \frac{\delta S}{\delta \phi^{(j)}} \mu^{ij} \equiv 0$
\end{proof}

This leads us to the following definition:

\begin{definition}[Trivial Symmetries]
  A local symmetry of the type $\omega = \mu(\delta S)$ is called a \textbf{trivial symmetry}. We denote the space of such trivial symmetries by $\tf$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lem}
  $\tf$ is an ideal in $\widetilde{\gf}$, thus $[\widetilde{\gf}, \tf] \subset \tf$.
\begin{proof}
  The proof is left as an exercise to the reader.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{rem}
  Note that if $\omega$ is trivial, $\lie{\omega}S = 0$ does \textbf{not} impose nontrivial conditions, thus no Noether Identities. They are not associated to nontrivial conservation laws, currents, charges etc. In particular they vanish on $Crit(S)$.
\end{rem}

No when treating theories with symmetries, we effectively want to work with a kind of quotient
$$ \gf := \widetilde{\gf}/\tf$$
Notice that $\mathfrak{J}$ is not necessarily a Lie subalgebra. However if
$$ [\tf, \gf] \subset \tf, \quad \quad [\gf, \gf] = \tf + \gf $$
and thus $\tf$ vanishes "on shell" (on $Crit(S)$), then \textbf{$\gf$ is a subalgebra on $Crit(S)$}. There are two main approaches to this:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Dealing with $\gf$'s that are closed everywhere (Lie subalgebras). This treatment is due to Beach, Rovet, Stara, Tyutin \textbf{(BRST)}
  \item More generally searching a formalism that can treat both scenarios. This leads to the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism \textbf{(BV)}.
\end{itemize}

Most cases of physical interest are such that $\gf$ is a Lie subalgebra but the conceptual generalisation of $BV$ will allow for
\begin{itemize}
  \item more general \textbf{gauge-fixing conditions}.
  \item a treatment of boundary data.
  \item observables in $BV$ that are more general than those in $BRST$.
\end{itemize}

Thus for the rest of the script assume that $\gf$ is a subalgebra.


\subsection{Lie algebra actions \& Lie algebra cohomology}

\begin{definition}[Lie group/algebra actions]
  Let $G$ be a Lie group with lie algebra $\gf$ and let $M$ be a smooth manifold.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A  \textbf{Lie group action} is a smooth map $R\colon G \times M \lra M$ such that for all $g \in G$ the map $R_g \colon M \lra M$ is a diffeomorphism. This is equivalent to $\widetilde{R} \colon G \lra Diff(M)$ being a group homomorphism.

    \item A \textbf{Lie algebra action} on $M$ is a Lie algebra morphism
    $$ \rho \colon \gf \lra \VF(M) $$

    \item If $\{t_a\}$ is a basis of $\gf$, the image $\{V_a = \rho(t_a)\}$ is a basis of \textbf{fundamental vector fields}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  Given $\widetilde{R}$ a Lie group action we obtain a Lie algebra action by
  $$ d \widetilde{R} |_{id} \colon \gf \lra \VF(M) $$
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[Tangent Distributions]
  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold. A \textbf{smooth (tangent) distribution} $\Delta$ of rank $k$ on $M$ is a subset $\Delta \subset TM$ such that $\forall p \in M$ the set $\Delta_p \subset T_p M$ is a $k$-dimensional subspace and such that there exists a neighbourhood $N_p$ over which there are $k$ linearly independent smooth vector fields with $\Delta_y = Span(X_1(y), ..., X_k(y))$ for $y \in N_p$. A smooth (tangent) distribution is \textbf{involutive} if $\Gamma(\Delta)$ forms a Lie subalgebra of $\VF(M)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{ex}
  Show that a Lie algebra action on $M$ induces an involutive distribution on $TM$.
\end{ex}

\begin{rem}
  Unsurprisingly, in infinite dimensions one need to be very careful. Say that $\delta \subset TM$ is a (smooth) subbundle. In order to keep the notion of a "finite rank" $k$ one can say that $\Delta_y$ is finitely generated as a $\Ci(M)$-span.\\
  Notice that in finite dimensions \textbf{Frobenius' Theorem} states that an involutive smooth distribution is tangent to an integral submanifold $N \subset M$ s.t. $TN \simeq \Delta$. Unfortunately this does not generally hold true in infinite dimensions. It does when the manifolds are Banach, however for Fréchet manifolds it does not necessarily. \textbf{Warning:} The Inverse Function Theorem can also fail in Fréchet manifolds.
\end{rem}

Now consider a Lie algebra action $\rho \colon \gf \lra \VF(M)$ and recall that $\VF(M) \simeq \Der(\Ci(M))$.

\begin{definition}
  The space of $\Ci(M)$-valued $k$-forms on $\gf$ is defined to be
  $$ C^k_{CE}(\gf ; \Ci(M)) := \Hom\left(\bigwedge^k \gf^*, \Ci(M)\right) $$
  This is called the \textbf{Chevally-Eilenberg} complex for the Lie algebra action $\rho \colon \gf \lra \Der(\Ci(M))$. Now define the map
  $$ d_{CE} \colon C^k_{CE}(\gf ; \Ci(M)) \lra C^{k+1}_{CE}(\gf ; \Ci(M)) $$
  as
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\forall f\in \Ci(M)$ we have $df(X)= \rho(X)(f) \ \forall X \in \gf$
    \item $\forall \alpha \in \gf^*$ we have $d_{CE}\alpha(X,Y) := - \alpha([X,Y]) \ \forall X,Y \in \gf$
    \item We extend to $\bigwedge^\bullet \gf^*$ using the Leibniz rule
    $$ d_{CE} (\alpha \wedge \beta) = d_{CE}\alpha \wedge \beta + (-1)^{|\alpha|} \wedge d_{CE} \beta $$
    where $|\alpha| = k$ if $\alpha \in \bigwedge^k\gf^*$
    \item We extend to $\bigwedge^\bullet \gf \otimes \Ci(M)$ by
    $$ d_{CE}(\omega \otimes f) = d_{CE} \omega \otimes f + (-1)^{|\omega|} \omega \otimes d_{CE} f$$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
  $d_{CE}^2 = 0$ and hence $(C_{CE}^\bullet(\gf ; \Ci(M))$ is a cochain complex.
\end{prop}

If $\{t_a\}$ is a basis of $\gf$ and $V_a = \rho(t_a)$, denote by $C^a \in \gf^*$ the coordinates in $\gf$, $\chi= C^a(X) t_a$, and structure constants $f_{ab}^c$ for the Lie algebra we obtain
$$ d_{CE} = C^a V_a - \frac{1}{2} f^d_{ab} C^a C^b \dell{}{C^d} $$
Now it is immediate to prove the above proposition.\\

The cohomology of the thus arising cochain complex is
$$ H^k(C_{CE}^\bullet; \Ci(M)) := \frac{\ker(d_{CE}|_{C^k})}{\ker(d_{CE}|_{C^{k-1}})} $$

\begin{rem}
  The set $H^\circ (C_{CE}^\bullet; \Ci(M))$ is the set of $f \in \Ci(M)$ such that
  $$ d_{CE} f = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad d_{CE} f(X) = 0 \quad \forall X\in \gf $$
  which means $\rho(X)(f) = 0$ and thus $f$ is \textbf{invariant}. Thus we obtain
  $$ H^\circ (C_{CE}^\bullet; \Ci(M)) \simeq \Ci(M)^\gf $$
  where $\Ci(M)^\gf$ are $\gf$-invariant smooth functions on $M$.
\end{rem}

On $\bigwedge^\bullet \gf^*$ there are the following natural operations:
\begin{align}
  \forall \alpha \in \gf^* \quad \mathcal{E}(\alpha) \colon \Lambda^k \gf^* &\lra \bigwedge^{k+1} \gf^*, \\
  \omega &\lmap \alpha \wedge \omega \\
  \forall X \in \gf \quad \imath(X) \colon \Lambda^k \gf^* &\lra \bigwedge^{k-1} \gf^*, \\
  \omega &\lmap \imath_X (\omega)
\end{align}

Now we extend $\imath_X$ by odd-Leibniz rule
$$ \imath_X(\alpha \wedge \beta) = (\imath_X \alpha) \wedge \beta + (-1)^{|\alpha|} \alpha \wedge (\imath_X \beta) $$
Now if $\{t_a\}$ and $\{\alpha^a\}$ are basis for $\gf$ and $\gf^*$ respectively, then
$$ d_{CE} = \mathcal{E}(\alpha^a) \rho(t_a) - \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{E}(\alpha^a) \mathcal{E}(\alpha^b) \imath_{[t_a, t_b]} $$
where we sum over repeated indices. This coincides with the formula above by defining $C^a \equiv \mathcal{E}(\alpha^a)$ and $\dell{}{C^a} \equiv \imath_{t_a}$. Thus we obtain
$$ C^a C^b = \mathcal{E}(\alpha^a) \alpha^b = - \mathcal{E}(\alpha^b) \alpha^a = - C^b C^a $$
such that
$$ d_{CE} = C^a V_a - \frac{1}{2} f_{ab}^d C^a C^b \dell{}{C^d} $$
Now we need to consider the collection $\{C^a\}$ as \textbf{odd coordinates}. This corresponds to the notion of \textbf{Ghost Variables} or \textbf{Ghost Fields} in physics. Thus we can formulate
$$ \Ci(M \times \gf[1]) \simeq \bigwedge^\bullet \gf^* \otimes \Ci(M) \cong \Hom(\bigwedge^\bullet \gf^*, \Ci(M)) $$
where $\gf[1]$ is a graded vector space, concentrated in degree $-1$. This leads us to
$$ C_{CE}^\bullet (\gf ; \Ci(M)) \simeq \Ci(M \times \gf[1]) $$
which allows us to think of $d_{CE}$ as a vector field of degree $1$ which squares to zero. Thus we can also think of it as a \textbf{cohomological vector field} on $M_{min}:=M \times \gf[1]$ such that
$$ \frac{1}{2} [d_{CE}, d_{CE}]_{\VF(M_{min})} = d_{CE}^2 = 0 $$

\subsection{BRST Formalism}

This subsection is dedicated to a consise formulation of the \textbf{Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin} (short BRST) formalism. Let $F$ be a smooth manifold endowed with a Lie algebra action
\begin{equation}
  \rho \colon \gf \lra \VF(F) \simeq \Der(\Ci(M))
\end{equation}

We associate to it the Chevally-Eilenberg complex
\begin{equation}
  C_{CE}^\bullet (\gf, \Ci(F)) \simeq \bigwedge^\bullet \gf^* \otimes \Ci(F) \simeq \Ci(F \times \gf[1]) = \Ci(F_{min})
\end{equation}

Now consider the product $F_{Aux} := \gf^* \times \gf^*[-1]$. We want to extend $d_{CE}$ to a cohomological vectorfield on
$$ F_{BRST} := F_{min} \times F_{Aux} $$
Luckily on $F_{Aux}$ there is a natural cohomological vector field:

\begin{lem}
  On $F_{Aux}$ consider the "vectorfield" $d_{Aux} \overline{c}_a = \lambda_a$ such that $d_{Aux} \lambda_a = 0$ where we are given a basis $\{e^a\}$ of $\gf^*$, the $\overline{c}_a$ are coordinates in $\gf^*[-1]$ and the $\lambda$ are coordinates in $\gf^*$. Then $d^2_{Aux} = 0$ and thus it is cohomological.
\end{lem}

Note that our conventions make $\overline{c}_a$ coordinates of degree $-1$ and $\lambda$ of degree $0$.

\begin{ex}
  Show that $\left( \Ci(F_{Aux}, d_{Aux}) \right) \simeq \left( \Omega^\bullet(\gf^*[-1], d_{dR}) \right)$. In particular, the cohomology of $\Ci(F_{Aux})$ vanishes.
\end{ex}

We do not want to change the cohomology of $F_{min}$, which we know represents invariant functions. Thus we aim for a prescription of the form
$$ F_{min} \lra F_{BRST} = F_{min} \times F_{Aux} $$
such that we only "add" fields that do not contribute. This allows for the following splitting:
$$ \Ci(F_{BRST}) \simeq \Ci(F) \otimes \bigwedge^\bullet \gf^* \otimes \bigwedge^\bullet \gf \otimes S^\bullet \gf \simeq C_{CE}^\bullet (\gf, \Ci(F)) \otimes \Omega^\bullet_{dR}(\gf^*[-1]) $$
which in turn allows us to define
\begin{equation}
  d_{BRST} := d_{CE} + d_{Aux}
\end{equation}
Note that the auxilary variables (fields) are often called \textbf{Nakanishi-Lautrup fields}.

Now let $S \in \Ci(F)$ such that $d_{CE} S = 0$ (namely $S$ is lifted to $F_{min}$). Then $S \in H^\circ (C^\bullet_{CE})$ and thus it is an invariant function. Now think of $S \in \Ci(F_{BRST})$ such that $S \in H^\circ(C^\bullet_{BRST}, d_{BRST})$. Thus applying gauge fixing we get for a gauge field $\psi_{gf}$ with $|\psi_{gf}| = 1$:
\begin{equation}
  S_{gf} = S + d_{BRST} \psi_{gf} \quad \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \quad  [S_{gf}]_{BRST} = [S]_{BRST}
\end{equation}
A valid question is, why this should be relevant. To understand this, recall that if $S \in C(F)^\gf$ this means that $\HH[S](x_0)$ is degenerate. How about if we choose a different representative $S_{gf} = S + d_{BRST} \psi_{gf}$ such that $\HH[S_{gf}](x_0)$ is non-degenerate? We will pick up this thought after a short digression:

\begin{rem}
  \textbf{Integration on Super/Graded manifolds}\\
  Note that everything formulated for super manifolds also applies to $\ZZ$-graded manifolds by sending a degree to the parity. Let $E \lra M$ be a rank $m$ vector bundle over $M$ where $\dim(M) = n$. Denote by $\Pi E=: \MM$ the (super) vector bundle obtained by shifting the parity of the fibre vector spaces

  \begin{definition}[Berezin line bundle]
    The (real) line bundle over $M$ defined by
    $$ Ber(\MM) := \bigwedge^{top} T^*M \otimes \bigwedge^m E $$
    is called the \textbf{Berezin line bundle} over $\MM$. A \textbf{Berezinian} is a smooth section of $Ber(\MM)$ denoted by $\mu \in \Gamma(M, Ber(\MM))$.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}[Berezin Integral]
    Given a section $\mu \in \Gamma(M, Ber(\MM))$ define the integration map
    $$ \int_{\MM} \cdot \mu \colon \Ci_c(\MM) \lra \RR $$
    defined as
    $$ \int_\MM f \mu = \int_M \langle \mu, (f)_m \rangle $$
    where $(f)_m$ is the component in $\Gamma_c(M, \bigwedge^m E)$ and $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle \colon \bigwedge^m E \otimes \bigwedge^m E^* \lra \RR$ is the fibrewise parity in $M$.
  \end{definition}

  Now consider a vector space $V$ and its parity-shifted version $\Pi V$. Now on $\Pi V$ let there be a function given as $f = f_0 + f_1 \theta$ with $f_0, f_1 \in \RR$ and $\theta$ an \emph{odd} coordinate such that
  $$ \int d\theta = 0 \quad  \quad \int d\theta \theta = 1 $$
  In $m$ dimensions we have
  $$ \int d^m \theta := \int d\theta^m \int ... \int d\theta^1 $$
  such that $\int d^m \theta \ \theta^1 ... \theta^m = 1$ and zero otherwise. Now $V^0 = V_m^\circ \oplus V^1_m$ such that we can decompose
  $$ f = f^0 + f^1_i \theta^i + f^2_{ij} \theta^i \theta^j + ... $$
  where $f^k \in \Ci(V^0)$. Now
  $$ \int_V f d^mx \ d^m \theta = \int_{V^\circ} f^{top} \ d^n x $$
  Thus changing coordinates in the form $\widetilde{\theta}^i = A^i_j \theta^j$ amounts to
  $$ \widetilde{\theta}^1 ... \widetilde{\theta}^m = \det(A) \theta^1 ... \theta^m $$
  Now we enforce
  $$ \int d^m \widetilde{\theta} \widetilde{\theta}^1 ... \widetilde{\theta}^m = 1 $$
  such that $d^m \widetilde{\theta} = (\det(A))^{-1} d^m \theta$. In general by pure construction
  $$ \langle \mu, (f)_{top} \rangle \in \Gamma(M, \bigwedge^n T^* M) $$
  is a top-form and can be integrated. One can generalize this entire construction by looking at
  \begin{equation}
    \widetilde{Ber}(\MM) := Ber(\MM) \otimes \bigwedge^\bullet E^* \simeq \bigwedge^n T^*M \otimes \bigwedge^m E \otimes \bigwedge^\bullet E^*
  \end{equation}
  which lets us define
  \begin{equation}
    BER(\MM) = \Gamma(\MM, \widetilde{Ber}(\MM))
  \end{equation}
  by letting $\mu \in BER(\MM)$ be non-constant along the fibres of $\rho \colon \MM \lra M$. Alternatively one can define $BER(\MM)= \Gamma(\MM, \rho^*Ber(\MM))$ as a $\Ci(\MM)$-module.

  \begin{example}
    Consider the shifted tangent bundle $\MM := \Pi TM$ and recall that $\Ci(\Pi TM) \simeq \Omega^\bullet(M)$. Now let us denote by $\tilde{f} \in \Omega^\bullet(M)$ the differential form associated to $f \in \Ci(\Pi TM)$. Define $\mu_{\Pi TM}$ as the Berezinian
    $$ \int_\MM \mu_{\Pi TM} f = \int_M \tilde{f} $$
    where we work in local coordinates $\{x^i, \theta_i\}$ and $\mu_{\Pi TM} = dx^i D\theta_i$.
  \end{example}

  Now to define the generalized version of the change of variables, consider the super vector space $\RR^{n|m} = \RC$, recall that $\RR^{n|m} = \RR^n \oplus \Pi \RR^m$ and take an endomorphism of $\RC$. Now parametrise the endomorphism, namely look at $J \in \End(\RC) \otimes \Ci(S)$ where $S$ denoted the parameter space.

  \begin{definition}[Super determinant]
    The \textbf{super determinant} of $J$ is the $\Ci(S)$-function
    $$ \sdet(J) = \det(D)^{-1} \cdot \det(A-BD^{-1} C) $$
  \end{definition}

  \begin{lem}
    The super determinant is
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Multiplicative: $\sdet(JK) = \sdet(J) \sdet(K)$
      \item $\sdet(1 + \epsilon J) = 1 + \epsilon \str(J)+ \OO(\epsilon^2)$ where $\str(J) := \tr(A) - \tr(D)$
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{corollary}
    $\sdet(\exp(J)) = \exp(\str(J))$

  \begin{theo}
    Let $\RR^{n|m}_1$ and $\RR^{n|m}_2$ be two copies of an $(n|m)$ super space with coordinates $\{x^i, \theta_a\}_k$ for $k = 1,2$. Consider the integral w.r.t the "coordinate" Berezinian
    \begin{equation}
      \mu_1 = \prod_{i,a} dx^i d\theta_a, \quad \quad \mu_2 = \prod_{j,b} dy^j d\psi_b
    \end{equation}
    Now let $\phi \colon \RR^{n|m}_1 \lra \RR^{n|m}_2$ be a smooth map of supermanifolds and let $f \in \Ci_c(\RR^{n|m}_2)$ such that
    $$ \int_{\RR^{n|m}_2} \mu_2 f = \int \mu_2 \sgn(\det(J_f^{nn})) \cdot \sdet(J_f) \phi^* f $$
    where
    \begin{align}
    J_f =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      J_f^{(nn)} & J_f^{(mn)} \\
      J_f^{(nm)} & J_f^{(mm)}
    \end{pmatrix} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \dell{y}{x} & \dell{y}{\theta} \\
      \dell{\psi}{x} & \dell{\psi}{\theta}
    \end{pmatrix}
    \end{align}
    Where we think of $J_f$ as a function in $\End(\RR^{n|m}) \otimes \Ci(\RR^{n|m})$.
  \end{theo}

  \begin{definition}
    Let $V \in \VF(\MM)$ for a super/graded manifold $\MM$ and let $\mu \in BER(\MM)$. The \textbf{divergence} of $V$ is the $\Ci(\MM)$ function $\diver_\mu(V) \in \Ci(\MM)$ such that
    $$ \forall f \in \Ci_c(\MM), \quad \int_\MM \mu V(f) = - \int_\MM \mu \diver_\mu(V) f$$
  \end{definition}

  \begin{lem}
    Let $\mu_0, \mu_1 \in BER(\MM)$ with
    $$ \mu_1 = \rho \mu_0 \quad \quad  \rho \in \Ci(\MM) $$
    then $V \in \VF(M)$, $\diver_{\mu_1}(V) = \diver_{\mu_0}(V) + V(\log(\rho))$
  \begin{proof}~
    \begin{align}
      \int \diver_{\mu_1}(V) f\mu_1 &= -\int \mu_1 V(F) = - \int \rho \mu_0 V(f)\\
      &= - \int \mu_0 V(\rho f) \mu_0 + \int V(\rho) f \mu_0 \frac{\rho}{\rho} \\
      &= \int \diver_{\mu_0} (V) (\rho f) \mu_0 + V(\log(\rho)) f \mu_0 \rho
    \end{align}
  \end{proof}
  \end{lem}

  \begin{lem}
    Let $\{x^i, \theta_a\}$ denote coordinates on the super manifold $\RR^{n|m}$ such that
    \begin{equation}
      \mu_{cord} = d^n x^i \prod_a D\theta_a
    \end{equation}
    Thus we write a vectorfield locally as
    \begin{equation}
      v = v^i \dell{}{x^i} + v^a \dell{}{\theta_a}
    \end{equation}
    its divergence reads
    \begin{equation}
      \diver_{\mu_{coord}} v = \partial_{x^i} v^i - (-1)^{|v|} \partial_{\theta_a} v^a
    \end{equation}
  \end{lem}
\end{rem}

\begin{lem}
  \begin{align}
    \diver_{\mu_{coord}} (d_{Aux}) &= 0 \\
    \diver_{\mu_{coord}} (d_{BRST}) &= \diver_{\mu_{coord}} (d_{CE}) = \sum_a c^a \left( \sum_b f^b_{ba} + \diver_F v_a \right)
  \end{align}
  where $v_a = \rho(t_a)$ for $\{t_a\}$ a basis of $\gf$.
\begin{proof}
  First note that
  $$ \diver_{\mu_{coord}} (d_{Aux}) = - \dell{}{\overline{c}_a} \lambda_a \equiv 0 $$
  which leads us to
  $$ \diver_{\mu_{coord}} (d_{CE}) = \dell{}{x^i} (c^a v_a^i) - \dell{}{c^d} \left(- \frac{1}{2} f^d_{ab}c^a c^b\right) = c^a \diver_F (v_a) + f^d_{db}c^b $$
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

This lemma lets us formulate and prove the main theorem of BRST:

\begin{theo}[BRST]
  Let $\rho \colon \gf \lra \VF(F)$ be a Lie algebra action on $F$ and let $\tilde{\mu}$ be a Berezinian on $F_{BRST}$ such that $\diver_{\tilde{\mu}}(d_{BRST}) = 0$. Define
  $$ \lrangle{h}_\psi := \frac{\int_{F_{BRST}} \exp(i/\hbar S_{gf})h \tilde{\mu}}{\int_{F_{BRST}} \exp(i/\hbar S_{gf})\tilde{\mu}} $$
  such that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $S_{gf} = S + d_{BRST} \psi, \ \ \psi \in \Ci(F_{BRST})^{(-1)}$
    \item $d_{BRST} S = 0, \ \ d_{BRST} h = 0$
  \end{enumerate}
  Then the following statements hold true:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[a.] $\lrangle{h}_\psi$ is locally constant in $\psi$
    \item[b.] If $g = d_{BRST} f \ \Rightarrow \ \lrangle{g}_\psi = 0 \ \forall \psi$
  \end{itemize}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\psi_t$ be a smooth family of "gauge fixing functions". Define
  \begin{equation}
    I_{\psi_t} = \int_{F_{BRST}} \exp(i/\hbar (S+ d_{BRST} \psi_t)) h \tilde{\mu}
  \end{equation}
  such that we can denote
  \begin{align}
    \dd{}{t} I_{\psi_t} &= \frac{i}{\hbar} \int_{F_{BRST}} d_{BRST}\left(\dd{}{t}\psi_t\right) \exp(i/\hbar (S_{gf}(t))) h \tilde{\mu} \\
    &= \frac{i}{\hbar} \int_{F_{BRST}} d_{BRST} \left( \dd{}{t}\psi_t \exp(i/\hbar (S_{gf}(t))) h \right) \tilde{\mu} \\
    &= - \frac{i}{\hbar} \int_{F_{BRST}} (...) \diver(d_{BRST}) \tilde{\mu} = 0
  \end{align}
  Now for the second part note that
  \begin{align}
    \int_{F_{BRST}} \exp(i/\hbar S) d_{BRST} f \tilde{\mu} = \int_{F_{BRST}} d_{BRST} (...) \tilde{\mu} = - \int_{F_{BRST}} \diver(d_{BRST}) \tilde{\mu} = 0
  \end{align}
  which proves our theorem.
\end{proof}
\end{theo}

Now given a Berezinian $\tilde{\mu}$ we always have $\diver_{\tilde{\mu}}(d_{BRST}) = 0$. Thus BRST integrals descend to the BRST cohomology. Namely the value of the integrals do not change if you change the representative of a cohomology class.
\begin{equation}
  \int_{F_{BRST}} \tilde{\mu} \ : H^\circ_{BRST} (\Ci(F_{BRST})) \lra \RR
\end{equation}
If $S$ has a degenerate Hessian, we make our transition to $S_{gf} = S + d_{BRST} \psi$. The divergence-free condition is strong. In general we are interested in $d_{BRST}$-closed quantities like $\exp(i/ \hbar S_{gf}) h$ but not in $d_{BRST}$-exact quantities.\\

When $\gf$ is unimodular then $\sum f^b_{ba} = 0$ and we can find a $\gf$-invariant measure on $F$, then $\diver(v_a) \equiv 0$ and thus in particular $\diver(d_{BRST}) = 0$.

\subsubsection{Interpretation of "gauge fixing"}
Consider, as before, a manifold $F$ together with a Lie group/algebra action of $G$ (or $\gf$). Further suppose that we are given an invariant functions $S \colon F \lra \RR$ where $S \in \Ci(F)^G$ and an invariant volume form $\mu_F \in \Omega^n(F)^G$ (if $F$ is non compact, take $\mu_F$ compactly supported). The action of the Lie group traces out orbits along which $S$ is constant.\\

Let us look at the integral
\begin{equation}
  I = \int_{F} \mu_F e^{i/\hbar S} \quad \lra \quad  I = \vol_G \int_{F / G} \widetilde{\mu}_F \ e^{i/\hbar \widetilde{S}}
\end{equation}

where $\rho \colon F \lra F/G$ projects to equivalence classes (the space of leaves of the foliation defined by the group action), and $\widetilde{S} \in \Ci(F/G)$ is such that $S = \rho^* \widetilde{S}$, while $\widetilde{\mu} \in \Omega^{n-m}(F/G)$ is such that for a basis $\{v_a\}$ where $v_a = \rho(t_a)$
\begin{equation}
  \imath_{v_m} ... \imath_{v_1} \mu = \rho^* \mu
\end{equation}
Now this point of view does not generalise very well because a quotient can be very badly behaved and finding $\widetilde{S}$ might not be easy. Alternativ we look for a "section" of the projection $\rho$, denoted by $J$, such that $\im(J)$ cuts the $G$-orbits. Practically one looks for a function
\begin{equation}
  \phi \colon F \lra \gf
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $0 \in \gf$ is a regular value for $\phi$
  \item $\Sigma := \phi^{-1}(0)$ intersects the $G$-orbits $N \geq 1$ times, transversally (locally, for $U$ a neighbourhood of an intersection point $T_p U = \gf \oplus T_p \Sigma$ for any $p \in \Sigma$)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{sketch}[Faddeev-Popov trick]
  This trick lets us write
  \begin{align}
    I = \frac{\vol(G)}{N} \int_\Sigma \left. \imath_{v_1} ... \imath_{v_m} \mu e^{i/\hbar S} \right|_\Sigma = \frac{\vol(G)}{N} \int_F \delta^{(m)}(\phi) \imath_{v_1} ... \imath_{v_m} \mu e^{i/\hbar S}
  \end{align}
  where $\delta^{(m)}(\phi) := \delta(\phi) \cdot \bigwedge_a d\phi^a$ is a distributional $m$-form.
\end{sketch}

\begin{lem}
  $\bigwedge d\phi^a \imath_{v_1} ... \imath_{v_m} \mu = \det(FP(x)) \cdot \mu$ where
  \begin{equation}
    FP(x) = d_x \phi \circ d_{(1,x)} \rho \colon \gf \lra \gf
  \end{equation}
  In components
  \begin{equation}
    [FP(x)]^b_a = \pair{d_x\phi^b(x)}{v_a(x)} = v_a (\phi^b)|_x
  \end{equation}
\begin{proof}
  $FP(x)$ is non-degenerate iff the intersection of $\phi^{-1}(\phi(x))$ with a $G$-orbit is transversal. In fact we have $\pair{d\phi}{v}_x = 0$ iff $v \in \ker(d\phi_x)$ which is equivalent to $v$ being tangent to $\phi^{-1}(\phi(x))$. Now assume transversality, i.e. non-degeneracy, and consider $V_x = \Span\{v_a^{(x)}\} \subset T_x F$. Now if we write the orbit as
  \begin{equation}
    \OO_x := \{xg \ | \ g \in G \}
  \end{equation}
  we observe $V_x \in T_x \OO$. Moreover if $\{\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_{n-m}\}$ is a basis, we can define
  \begin{equation}
    Ann(V_x) := \{ \alpha \in T_x F | \pair{\alpha}{v} = 0 \ \forall v \in V \} \subset T^*_x F
  \end{equation}
  Now a basis for $T^*_x F$ is $\{d\phi^1(x), ..., d\phi^m(x), \alpha_1, ..., \alpha_{n-m} \}$. Thus we define
  \begin{equation}
    \mu = \bigwedge_{a=1}^m d\phi^a  \wedge \alpha_1 \wedge ... \wedge \alpha_{n-m}
  \end{equation}
  with a little care we now observe
  \begin{align}
    \imath_{v_1} ... \imath_{v_m} \mu &= \left( \sum_{\sigma \in S_m} (-1)^S \prod_{a = 1}^m \pair{d\phi^a(x)}{v_{S(a)}(x)} \right) \alpha_1 \wedge ... \wedge \alpha_{n-m}\\
    &= \det(FP(x)) \cdot \alpha_1 \wedge ... \wedge \alpha_{n-m}
  \end{align}
  Now conclude the proof by "wedging" with $\bigwedge d\phi^a$ to arrive at the statement of the lemma.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

We will need to keep this lemma in mind when going forward. Another helpful lemma is the following.

\begin{lem}
  Denote by $Dc D\overline{c}$ the coordinate Berezinians on $\gf[1] \oplus \gf^*[-1]$. Then
  \begin{equation}
    \det(FP(x)) = \frac{\hbar}{i} \int_{\gf[1] \oplus \gf^*[-1]} DcD\overline{c} \exp(i/\hbar \pair{\overline{c}}{FP \cdot c})
  \end{equation}
  The splitting $\gf[1] \oplus \gf^*[-1]$ was the original interpretation of \emph{ghosts/antighosts}. Moreover we now have an integral representation of the delta function in the form of
  \begin{equation}
    \delta(\phi(x)) = \frac{1}{(2\pi\hbar)^m} \int_{\gf^*} d^m \lambda e^{i/\hbar \pair{\lambda}{\phi(x)}}
  \end{equation}
\end{lem}

\begin{theo}[Faddeev-Popov]
\label{theorem:FP}
  \begin{align}
    I &= \int_F \exp(i/\hbar S) = \frac{\vol(F)}{N} \int_F \mu \delta(\phi) \det(FP) e^{i/\hbar S} \\
    &= \frac{\vol(F)}{N} \int_{F \times \gf[1] \times \gf^*[-1] \times \gf^*} \mu DcD\overline{c} d^m \lambda \exp\left( \frac{i}{\hbar} \left( S + \pair{\lambda}{\phi(x)} + \pair{\overline{c}}{FP(x) c} \right)\right)
  \end{align}
\end{theo}

\begin{theo}[FP within BRST]
\label{theorem:FP_BRST}
  Choose $\psi = \pair{\overline{c}}{\phi} \in \Ci(F_{BRST})^{(-1)}$. Then
  \begin{equation}
    S_{gf} = S + d_{BRST} \psi = S_{FP}
  \end{equation}
\begin{proof}
  Note that
  \begin{align}
    d_{BRST} \psi = \pair{d_{BRST} \overline{c}}{\phi} + \pair{\overline{c}}{d_{BRST} \phi}
  \end{align}
  such that we can write
  \begin{align}
    d_{BRST} \phi = c^a v_a (\phi) = - \pair{d\phi}{v_a} c^a
  \end{align}
\end{proof}
\end{theo}

\begin{rem}
  FP \ref{theorem:FP} is quite restrictive if you formulate it in a mathematically precise way. Nevertheless we \emph{can} intepret it as a cohomological procedure which works with fewer assumptions. However this is not fully satisfying for the following reasons:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Cumbersome minimal/nonminimal extension is \textbf{needed} to introduce $\psi$.
    \item BRST is inherently limited to Lie algebra actions. Thus $\widetilde{\gf} = \tf \oplus \gf$ where $\gf$ is a subalgebra.
    \item The space of invariant functions, in physical terminology called \textbf{"The Observables"} are quantities that, in principle, can be measured. In BRST they do \textbf{not} "know" anything about $S$.
  \end{enumerate}

  Solving all of those problems we will look at functions that are invariant on $Crit(S)$, not globally. To incorporate this idea from the start will lead us to the \textbf{BV formalism}.
\end{rem}


\subsection{BV Formalism}
\label{subsec:BVFormalism}

The main idea of the BV formalism is to look at the space of functions invariant on $Crit(S)$ and not necessarily global. This less restrictive setting will eliminate many of the problems the BRST formulation inherently attains form its rather restrictive formulation.

\subsubsection{Symplectic Preliminaries}
First let us recall some background on graded symplectic geometry:\\
If $\MM$ is a graded/super manifold, we define $\Omega^\bullet(\MM)$ as $\Ci(T[1]\MM)$. So if $\{x^i, \theta_a\}$ are coordinates on $\MM$, we can introduce $\{dx^i, d\theta_a\}$ as coordinates on the shifted fibres. Generally in $\ZZ$-grading there are two relevant degrees:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The de Rham "form degree" denoted by $\deg_{dR}$
  \item The internal degree (grade) that comes from the $\ZZ$-grading denoted by
  $$ \gr(x^i) = \gr(dx^i), \quad \quad \gr(\theta_a) = \gr(d\theta_a) $$
\end{itemize}
This is useful to decide the signs in the explicit calculations by defining the \textbf{total degree}:
\begin{equation}
  \td = \deg_{dR} + \gr
\end{equation}
Now recall that a graded $k$-symplectic manifold is a $\ZZ$-graded manifold $\MM$ together with a closed nondegenerate $2$-form $\omega$ of grade $\gr(\omega) = k$.
\begin{equation}
  \omega^\# \colon T\MM \atob{\sim} T^* \MM
\end{equation}
Now in infinite dimensions, one speaks of \emph{weak symplectic} forms, if $d \omega = 0$, such that $\omega^\#$ is \emph{injective}. For special cases we can use the following result due to Schwarz

\begin{theo}[Schwarz]
  Let $(\MM, \omega)$ be a $(-1)$-symplectic graded manifold with body manifold $M$. Then
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item In the neighbourhood of any point of $M$, there are local coordinates on $\MM$ denoted by $\{x^i, \xi_i\}$ such that $\omega = \sum_i dx^i \wedge d\xi_i$.

    \item There exists a global (non-canonical) symplectomorphism
    \begin{equation}
      \phi \colon (\MM, \omega) \lra (T^*[-1]\MM, \omega_{can}), \quad \quad \omega_{can} = \sum_i dx^i \wedge d\xi_i
    \end{equation}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theo}

Note that the first statement of this theorem corresponds to a generalized variant of the \emph{Darboux Theorem} from usual symplectic geometry.

\begin{definition}[Lagrangian Submanifolds]
  A submanifold $\LL \subset \MM$ for $k$-symplectic $\MM$ is a \textbf{Lagrangian submanifold} in $\MM$ iff it is maximally isotropic, i.e. $\LL$ is isotropic ($\omega|_\LL = 0$) and it is not properly contained in any other isotropic submanifold.
\end{definition}

In finite dimensions one can prove that $\LL$ being Lagrangian is equivalent to it being isotropic and coisotropic. This means that $\LL$ is isotropic and its symplectic complement $\LL^\omega$ is too. Thus we also have $\dim(\LL) = \frac{1}{2} \dim(\MM)$.

\begin{definition}[Conormal Bundle]
  Let $C$ be a submanifold of $M$. We can look at $ N^* C \subset (T^*M)|_C $ as the bundle over $C$ with fibre
  \begin{equation}
    N_x^* C := \left \{ \alpha \in T_x^*M \big| \pair{\alpha}{v} = 0 \ \forall v \in T_x C \right\}
  \end{equation}
  We call $N^* C$ the \textbf{conormal bundle} of $C \subset M$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Conormal Lagrangian]
  Let $C \subset M$ be a smooth submanifold. The shifted conormal bundle
  \begin{equation}
    N^*[-1]C \subset T^*[-1]M
  \end{equation}
  is a Lagrangian submanifold. The proof is left as an interesting exercise to the reader.
\end{example}

Another important theorem, which will be given without proof due to the lack of time in this course, is the following results from symplectic geometry:

\begin{theo}[Weinstein Tubular nbdh Theorem in $(-1)$-symplectic context]
  Let $\LL \subset \MM$ be Lagrangian in $\MM$ where $\MM$ is $(-1)$-symplectic. Then there exist
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item a tubular neighbourhood $U \subseteq \MM$ of $\LL$, i.e. a vector bundle $p \colon E \lra \LL$ together with a smooth map $K \colon E \lra \MM$ such that
    \begin{equation}
      J \circ 0_E = i, \quad \quad i \colon \LL \lra \MM
    \end{equation}
    and there exists $V \subseteq E$ with $0_E(\LL) \subset V$ such that $J|_V \atob{\sim} U$ is a diffeomorphism.

    \item a tubular neighbourhood $U_0 \subset T^*[-1] \LL$ (with projection $p_0$) of the zero section $\LL_0 \equiv \LL$.

    \item a symplectomorphism $\phi \colon U \atob{\sim} U_0$ such that $\phi(\LL) = \LL_0$ and $p_0 \circ \phi = \phi|_\LL \circ p$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theo}

Thus in a neighbourhood of a Lagrangian submanifold, the ambient $(-1)$-symplectic manifold is locally symplectomorphic to $T^*[-1]\LL$.

\begin{example}[BRST Graph Lagrangian]
  Consider $F_{BRST}$ as we defined it in the previous section ($F_{BRST} = F \times \gf[1] \times \gf^*[-1] \times \gf^*$) and let $\psi \in \Ci(F_{BRST})^{(-1)}$. Then
  \begin{equation}
    \NC_\psi := \graph(d \psi) \subset T^*[-1]F_{BRST}
  \end{equation}
  is a Lagrangian submanifold. Denote by $\{\phi^a\}$ coordinates in $F_{BRST}$ and by $\{\phi^t_a\}$ coordinates in the fibre. Then
  \begin{equation}
    \graph(d \psi) = \left\{ (\phi^a, \phi^t_a) \ \Bigg| \ \phi^t_a = \dell{}{\phi_a} \psi \right\}
  \end{equation}
  We also define
  \begin{align}
    \omega |_{\NC_\psi} :&= \pair{d\phi^t}{d\phi} |_{\NC_\psi} = d \phi^t_a d\phi^a |_{\NC_\psi} \\
    &= d\phi^b \partial_b \partial_a d\psi^a = 0
  \end{align}
  As an exercise check that $\dim(\graph(d \psi)) = \frac{1}{2} \dim(T^*[-1]F_{BRST})$. For $\psi = 0$ we get $\NC_0$ equal the zero section, thus $\NC_\psi$ is a kind of \emph{deformation} of the zero section.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Classification of Lagrangians}

Let $\MM$ be a graded $(-1)$-symplectic manifold. Then
\begin{enumerate}
  \item for $\LL \subset \MM$ a Lagrangian submanifold, there exists a submanifold $C \subset M$ and a symplectomorphism $\phi \colon \MM \atob{\sim} T^*[-1]M$ such that $\phi(\LL) = \LL_C \equiv \NC^*[-1] C \subset T^*[-1]M$.

  \item for $\LL \subset \MM$ a Lagrangian submanifold obtained from $\LL_C = \NC^*[-1] C$ where $C \subset M$ as a graph of $d\psi$ for some $\psi \in \Ci(\LL_C)^{(-1)}$ we can use the tubular neighbourhood theorem to identify the neighbourhood of $\LL_C$ with $T^*[-1]\LL_C$.
\end{enumerate}

We say that $\LL \sim \LL^\prime$ homotopic as Lagrangian submanifolds, iff there exists a family of Lagrangian submanifolds $\LL_t$ smoothly varying over  such that $\LL_0 = \LL$ and $\LL_1 = \LL^\prime$ for $t \in [0,1]$.

\begin{definition}
  Let $(\MM, \omega)$ be a $(n|n)$-dimensional $(-1)$-symplectic graded manifold. A Berezinian $\mu$ on $\MM$ is called \textbf{compatible with} $\omega$, if there exists an atlas of Darboux charts $\{ x^i, \xi_i\}$ such that $\mu = d^nx D^n \xi$ in every chart. We also say that the triple $(\MM, \omega, \mu)$ is compatible.
\end{definition}

Now for $(\MM, \omega, \mu)$ compatible we introduce with
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{BV} \colon \Ci(\MM) \lra \Ci(\MM)
\end{equation}
the "Batalin-Vilkovisky" Laplacian defined locally in any Darboux chart as the degree $+1$ second-order operator
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{BV} = \sum_i \dell{}{x^i} \dell{}{\xi_i}
\end{equation}

\begin{lem}
  $\Delta_{BV}$ is well defined and $\Delta_{BV}^2 = 0$.
\begin{proof}
  Compatibility of $\omega$ and $\mu$ implies that the transition functions are unimodular i.e.
  $$ \sdet\left( \dell{(x, \xi)}{(y, \theta)} \right) = 1 $$
  Now the fact that the BV-Laplacian squares to $0$ can be seen by looking at
  \begin{equation}
    \Delta_{BV}^2 = \sum_{i,j} \dell{}{x^i} \dell{}{x^j} \dell{}{\xi_i} \dell{}{\xi_j}
  \end{equation}
  and then mapping $(j,i) \ra (j,i)$. Using antisymmetry we obtain the statement.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{definition}
  Let $(\MM, \omega)$ be a $(-1)$-symplectic graded manifold with Berezinian $\mu$. Define the $\mu$-Laplacian
  \begin{equation}
    \Delta_\mu \colon \Ci(\MM) \lra \Ci(\MM), \quad \quad \Delta_\mu f := \frac{1}{2} \diver_\mu(X_f)
  \end{equation}
  where $\imath_{X_f} \omega = df$, i.e. $X_f$ is the Hamiltionian vector field of $f$.
\end{definition}

If $\{\cdot, \cdot\}$ denotes the Poisson-brackets, we get $X_f = \{f, \cdot\}$ such that $\{f,g \} = X_f (g)$. For a Darboux chart $\{x^i, \xi_i\}$ and assuming that $\mu = \rho \cdot \mu_{coord}$ we obtain the following result:

\begin{lem}
  $\Delta_\mu = \Delta_{BV} + \frac{1}{2} \{f, \log(\rho)\}$.
\begin{proof}
  First note that
  \begin{equation}
    \Delta_{BV} f = - \frac{1}{2} \diver_{\mu_{coord}}(X_f)
  \end{equation}
  and further
  \begin{equation}
    \diver_{\mu_{coord}}(X_f) = \dell{}{x^i} X_f^{(x^i)} - \dell{}{\xi_i} X_f^{(\xi_i)}
  \end{equation}
  Together this lets us write
  \begin{align}
    \imath_{X_f} \omega = df \quad  &\Longleftrightarrow \quad  \imath_{X_f} dx^i d\xi_i = \dell{f}{x^i} dx^i - \dell{f}{\xi_i} d\xi_i \\
     \quad &\Longleftrightarrow \quad  X_f^{(x^i)} = \dell{f}{x^i} \quad and \quad X_f^{(\xi_i)} = \dell{f}{\xi_i}
  \end{align}
  This allows us to reformulate the divergence of the Hamiltionian vector field as
  \begin{align}
    \diver_{\mu_{coord}}(X_f) &= - \dell{}{x^i} \dell{}{\xi_i} f - \dell{}{\xi_i} \dell{}{x^i} f \\
    &= - 2 \sum_i \dell{}{x^i} \dell{}{\xi_i} f = - 2 \Delta_{BV} f
  \end{align}
  Now using $\diver_{\rho \mu_{coord}} (X) = \diver_{\mu_{coord}} (X) + X(\log(\rho))$ we can conclude
  \begin{equation}
    \Delta_\mu f = \Delta_{BV} f + \frac{1}{2} \{ f, \log(\rho) \}
  \end{equation}
  which proves the statement.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{rem}
  Note that $\Delta_\mu$ does not necessarily square to $0$ as $\Delta_{BV}$ does. However it always will if $\mu$ is compatible with $\omega$.
\end{rem}

\subsubsection{BV Integrals}
Notice that so far we did not talk about physics at all. We merely introduced several notions about $(-1)$-symplectic manifolds. Having a well-defined integration will bring us quite a few steps closer to a physical theory using the given framework. To this end recall that $Ber(\MM) = \bigwedge^m T^* M \otimes \bigwedge^m E$. If $\MM = T^*[-1] M$ we obtain $Ber(\MM) = (\bigwedge^n T^*M)^{\otimes 2}$, namely two copies of top-forms on $M$. Similarly if $\NC$ is a graded manifold $Ber(T^*[-1]\NC)|_\NC \cong Ber(\NC)^{\otimes 2}$.\\

%TODO diagram

There is a canonical map sending a Berezinian $\mu$ on $T^*[-1]\NC$ to a Berezinian on $\NC$. We denote the induced Berezinian by $\sqrt{\mu|_\NC}$. Locall, denoting mixed-parity/degree coordinates on $\NC$ by $\{X^a\}$ and with $\{X^a, \Xi_a \}$ a Darboux chart for $T^*[-1]\NC$ we can write
\begin{equation}
  \mu = \rho \mu_{coord} = \rho(X, \Xi) \prod_a DX^a D\Xi_a
\end{equation}
which is mapped to the following Berezinian on $\NC$:
\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{\mu|_\NC} := \sqrt{\rho(X, \Xi)} DX
\end{equation}

\begin{definition}[BV Integral]
  Let $(\MM, \omega, \mu)$ be compatible. A \textbf{BV integral} is an integral of the form
  \begin{equation}
    I_\LL = \int_{\LL \subset \MM} f \sqrt{\mu|_\LL}
  \end{equation}
  where $\LL$ is a Lagrangian submanifold and $f \in \Ci(M)$ such that $\Delta_\mu f = 0$.
\end{definition}

Now consider $T[1]M$ and $T^*[-1]M$ with coordinates $\{x^i, \theta^i \}$ and $\{x^i, \xi_i \}$ respectively. We can think of the deRham differential on $M$ as a cohomological vector field
\begin{align}
  &D \colon \Ci(T[1]M) \simeq \Omega^\circ(M) \lra \Omega^\circ(M) \\
  &D^2 = 0, \quad D = \theta^i \dell{}{x^i}, \quad \theta^i = dx^i
\end{align}
Now if $\vol_M = \rho(x) dx^1 ... dx^n$ is a volume form on $M$ we arrive at the following statement:

\begin{lem}
  The following two statements hold true when we consider coordinate transformations of the form $\widetilde{\theta} = \widetilde{\theta}(x, \theta)$ or $\widetilde{\xi} = \widetilde{\xi}(x, \xi)$:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $ \int d^n \widetilde{\theta} \widetilde{\rho}^{-1} = \int d^n \theta \rho^{-1} $
    \item $ \int d^n \widetilde{\xi} \widetilde{\rho} = \int d^n \xi \rho $
  \end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
  First note that
  \begin{equation}
    \widetilde{\vol}_M = \vol_M \quad \Lra \quad \widetilde{\rho} = \left[ \det \dell{\widetilde{x}}{x} \right]^{-1} \rho
  \end{equation}
  However
  \begin{align}
    d^m \widetilde{\theta} &= \left[ \det \dell{\widetilde{x}}{x} \right] d^m \theta \\
    d^m \widetilde{\xi} &= \left[ \det \dell{\widetilde{x}}{x} \right]^{-1} d^m \xi
  \end{align}
  which proves the statement.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

Now we define an adapted version of the well-known \emph{Fourier Transformation}:

\begin{definition}[Odd Fourier Transformation]
  Let $f \in \Ci(T^*[-1]M)$ with $f = f(x, \xi)$. The \textbf{odd Fourier Transformation} is the map
  \begin{equation}
    \FF_\rho \colon \Ci(T^*[-1]M) \lra \Ci(T[1]M)
  \end{equation}
  given by its action on functions $f$ as above by
  \begin{equation}
    \widetilde{f} := \FF_\rho [f](x, \theta) := \int d^n \xi \ \rho \ e^{\theta^i \xi_i} f(x, \xi)
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

An interesting result reagrding the odd Fourier Transformation is the following:

\begin{prop}
  $\FF \circ \Delta = d \circ \FF$
\begin{proof}
  The proof is left as an exercise to the reader.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

Otherwise one can show that for $g \in \Ci(T[1]M)$ one can define
\begin{equation}
  \FF^{-1}[g] = \int \int d^n \theta \ \rho^{-1} \ e^{\xi_i \theta^i} g(x, \theta)
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{equation}
  \FF^{-1}[dg(x, \theta)] = \Delta(\FF^{-1}[g])
\end{equation}

Now we can finally formulate the main result shouldering the BV formalism:

\begin{theo}[Batalin-Vilkovisky-Schwarz Theorem]
  Let $(\MM, \omega, \mu)$ be a compatible $(-1)$-symplectic graded manifold with Berezinian $\mu$. The following statements hold true:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For any $g \in \Ci(\MM)$ and a Lagrangian submanifold $\LL \subset \MM$
    \begin{equation}
      \int_\LL \Delta_\mu g \sqrt{\mu_\LL} = 0
    \end{equation}

    \item Let $\LL$ and $\LL^\prime$ be two Lagrangian submanifolds whose bodies are homologous (as cycles) in the body of $\MM$ and let $f \in \Ci(M)$ such that $\Delta_\mu f = 0$. Then
    \begin{equation}
      \int_\LL f \sqrt{\mu_\LL} = \int_{\LL^\prime} f \sqrt{\mu_{\LL^\prime}}
    \end{equation}
  \end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
  This proof is more of a sketch. You can fill in the details with the material at hand. Assume that $\mu = \rho \mu_{coord}$ and $\LL = \LL_C = N^*[-1]C$ for $C \subset M$ a submanifold of $M$. Then the BV integral can be seen as the map
  \begin{equation}
    f \lmap \int_{\LL_C} f \sqrt{\mu_{\LL_C}} = \int_C \widetilde{f}\ \Big|_C
  \end{equation}
  where $\widetilde{f}$ is the form representative of a function $f$ and the right hand side is thus seen as the integral of a differential form on $C$. Then in particular
  \begin{equation}
    \int_{\LL_C} \Delta_\mu g \sqrt{\mu_{\LL_C}} = \int_C d\widetilde{g} = 0
  \end{equation}
  and further
  \begin{equation}
    \int_{\LL^\prime_C} f \sqrt{\mu_{\LL^\prime_C}} - \int_{\LL_C} f \sqrt{\mu_{\LL_C}} = \left( \int_{C^\prime} - \int_{C} \right) \widetilde{f} = \int_D d\widetilde{f} = 0
  \end{equation}
  We obtain the last equation by seeing that
  \begin{equation}
    d \widetilde{f} = d \FF(f) = \FF \Delta f = 0
  \end{equation}
  as required per definition. Now since $\LL \sim \LL^\prime$ are homologous as cycles, $\LL \equiv \LL_C$ and $\LL^\prime = \LL^\prime_C$ such that there necessarily exists a submanifold $D \subset M$ with $\partial D = C^\prime - C$.\\

  Now for a general Lagrangian submanifold part $a)$ of the classification tells us that we can reconstruct the calculation for general Lagrangian submanifolds to that of conormal type to prove the first statement of the theorem. To prove the second, we use the second part of the classification together with the following:\\

  Let $\LL_t$ be a smooth family of Lagrangian submanifolds such that
  \begin{equation}
    \LL_{t+\epsilon} = \graph(\epsilon d\psi_t + \OO(\epsilon^2))
  \end{equation}
  for a function $\psi_t \in \Ci(\LL_t)^{(-1)}$. Then for $f \in \Ci(\MM)$ such that $\Delta_\mu f = 0$ we have
  \begin{equation}
    \dd{}{t} \int_{\LL_t} f \sqrt{\mu_{\LL_t}} = \int_{\LL_t} \Delta_\mu (f \cdot \psi_t) \sqrt{\mu_{\LL_t}}
  \end{equation}
  This can be separately proven by investigating
  \begin{equation}\tag{$\diamond$} \label{eq:limeq}
    \limit{\epsilon \lra 0} \left[ \frac{1}{\epsilon} \int_{\LL_{t + \epsilon}} f \sqrt{\mu_{\LL_{t + \epsilon}}} - \int_{\LL_{t}} f \sqrt{\mu_{\LL_{t}}} \right]
  \end{equation}
  To this end note that
  \begin{align}
    &\limit{\epsilon \lra 0} \ \ \frac{1}{\epsilon} \int_{\LL_{t}} \left( f(x, \epsilon d\psi_t + \epsilon^2) - f(x, \epsilon d\psi_t) \right) \sqrt{\mu_{\LL_{t}}} \\
    = \ &\limit{\epsilon \lra 0} \ \ \frac{1}{\epsilon} \int_{\LL_{t}} \left( f(x, \epsilon d\psi_t) - f(x, \epsilon d\psi_t) + \OO(\epsilon^2) \right) \sqrt{\mu_{\LL_{t}}} \\
    = \ &\int_{\LL_{t}} f(x, d\psi_t) \sqrt{\mu_{\LL_{t}}}
  \end{align}
  Now since
  \begin{align}
    \Delta(f \cdot \psi_t) = \Delta f \cdot \psi_t + f \cdot \Delta \psi_t + \dell{f}{\xi} \dell{\psi}{x} \equiv f(x, d\psi_t)
  \end{align}
  we can rewrite \eqref{eq:limeq} as

  \begin{equation}
    (\diamond) \ = \ \int_{\LL_{t}} \Delta_\mu (f \cdot \psi_t) \sqrt{\mu_{\LL_{t}}}
  \end{equation}
  Since the last equation vanishes by rule of the first statement of the proof, we only need to find a family $\LL_t$ connecting $\LL$ to $\LL_C$ but this is immeadiate.
\end{proof}
\end{theo}

The BV integral vanished on $\Delta$-exact functions because regular integral vanish on $d$-exact forms. The BV integral does not depend on a particular Lagrangian inside a family of Lagrangians like $\LL_t$ if the function is $\Delta$-closed, since $d$-closed forms have the same property.

\subsection{Classical and Quantum BV formalism}

\begin{definition}[BV Theory]
  The following set of data is called a \textbf{classcial BV theory}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A $\ZZ$-graded manifold $\FF$ (the space of BV fields)
    \item A $(-1)$-symplectic structure $\omega \in \Omega^2(\FF)^{(-1)}$ (the BV $2$-form)
    \item A function $S \in \Ci(\FF)^{(0)}$ satisfying the Classical Master Equation \ref{ClassicalMasterEquation} $\{S, S\}_\omega = 0$ (the BV action or master action)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{rem}
  Often it is convenient to work with the cohomological vector field $Q := \{S, \ \cdot \ \}$ or alternatively $\imath_Q \omega = dS$. Observe that $\lie{Q} \omega = 0$, i.e. $\imath_Q \omega$ is closed, but the degree reasons that we can always find $S$ given $Q$ with $\lie{Q} \omega = 0$ such that $\imath_Q \omega = dS$.
\end{rem}

An important example which includes a huge part of interesting theories is the following:

\begin{example}[BV-BRST]
  Recall the construction of BRST data $(F_{min}, d_{CE}, S_0)$ and $(F_{BRST}, d_{BRST}, S_0)$. Now
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item define $\FF := T^*[-1]F_{min} \atob{p} F_{min}$ with $\omega_{BV}$ the canonical symplectic form.
    \item define $S_{BV} = p^* S_0 + \widehat{d}_{CE}$ and recall that $\widehat{d}_{CE}$ is the function $\Ci(T^*[-1]F_{min})$ corresponding to a vector field on $F_{min}$.
    \item define $Q_{BV} = X_{p^*S_0} + d_{CE}^{cl}$  where $d_{CE}^{cl}$ is the cotangent lift of $d_{CE}$ to $T^*[-1]F_{min}$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Now in a Darboux chart $\{\phi^a, \phi^t_a\}$ we can write
  \begin{align}
    \omega_{BV} &= \sum_a d\phi^a \wedge d\phi^t_a \\
    S_{BV} &= S_0 + \sum_a \Phi^a d^a_{CE}
  \end{align}
  where $d^a_{CE} = d_{CE}(\Phi^a)$. Then we arrive at $Q_{BV}$ such that
  \begin{equation}
    \imath_{Q_{BV}} \omega_{BV} = dS_{BV}
  \end{equation}
\end{example}

\begin{notation}
  For $T^*[-1]F_{min}$ the coordinates $(x^i, c^a)$ introduce coordinates on the fibre $(x^\dagger_i, c^\dagger_a)$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    |x^i| &= 0 \quad \Lra \quad |x_i^\dagger| = -1, \\
    |c^a| &= 1 \quad \Lra \quad |c_a^\dagger| = -2,
  \end{align*}
  In literature one often call the $x^i$ "physical fields" (degree $0$), the $c^a$ "ghost fields" (Chevally-Eilenberg generators), the $x_i^\dagger$ "anti-fields" (degree $-1$) and the $c_a^\dagger$ "antighosts" (degree $-2$).\\

  Note that for $V^\bullet$ a graded vector space, $(V^\bullet)^{* (-k)} = (V^\bullet)^{(k)}$.
\end{notation}

Now while we already have a rough idea of physical and ghost fields, we need further investigation on the role of anti-fields and antighosts.


\subsubsection{Constructing BV data}

The main goal of this section is to construct the data necessary for a complete BV theory. This in turn will allows for a more insightful description of anti-fields and antighosts. Let $F$ be a smooth finite-dimensional manifold and let ${x^i}$ be coordinates on $F$ together with a function $S \in \Ci(F)$ in degree $0$.\\

Now the set $\left\{\phi_i := \dell{S}{x^i}\right\}$ determines an ideal $I_S \subset \Ci(\FF)$ of functions vanishing on $\Crit(S) := \{ x \in F \ | \ dS(x) = 0 \}$
Assume for now that there are no nontrivial symmetries of $S$. Now we \textbf{want} a complex $(\KK^\bullet, d_\KK)$ such that its cohomology in degree $0$ is the quotient $\Ci(F)/I_S \simeq \Ci(\Crit(S))$.\\

The following is due to \emph{Koszul}:\\
Let $V^\bullet$ be a graded vector space such that $\dim(V) = \dim(F)$, e.g. $V \simeq T^*_x F$. For every coordinate $x^i$ generate a new coordinate $x^\dagger_i \in \Ci(V[-1]) \simeq \bigwedge^\bullet V^*$. Then we can define an operator $d_\KK$ on $\Ci(F) \otimes \Ci(V[-1]) =: \KK^\bullet$ by setting
\begin{equation}
  d_\KK x^\dagger_i := \phi^i \equiv \dell{S}{x^i}
\end{equation}
Thus in particular $d_\KK^2 = 0$ and $H^\circ(\KK^\bullet)/I_S$. Further for $f \in \KK^{(0)}$ we have $d_\KK f = 0 \ \Leftrightarrow \ f \in \Ci(F)$ but $f = d_\KK g \ \Leftrightarrow \ f \in I_S$ i.e. $fg = \sum_i g^i x^\dagger_i$.

\begin{prop}
  The \textbf{Koszul complex} $(\KK^\bullet, d_\KK)$ is a \textbf{resolution} of $\Ci(F)/I_S$.
\begin{proof}
  We want a complex $C^\bullet$ such that $H^\circ(C^\bullet) \simeq \Ci(F)/I_S \simeq \Ci(\Crit(S))$ and further $H^{-i} (C^\bullet) = 0$ for all $i > 0$. In our case $H^{-1} \neq 0$ iff $\exists R^i_\alpha$ such that $d_\KK (R^i_\alpha x^\dagger_i) = R^i_\alpha \phi^i = 0$ since there is nothing in degree $-2$ that can compensate the cocycle $R^i_\alpha x^\dagger_i$.\\

  However $R^i_\alpha \phi^i \equiv R^i_\alpha \dell{S}{x^i} = 0$ (\textbf{Noether identity}) is equivalent to there being a vector field $V_\alpha \in \VF(F)$ with $V_\alpha = R^i_\alpha \dell{}{x^i}$ and such that $V_\alpha(S) = 0$. Namely such a cocycle exists iff $S$ admits nontrivial symmetries which we ruled out in the definition. This proves the claim.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

Now the coordinates $x^\dagger_i$ that were introduced in the BV construction are in fact \emph{Koszul generators}
\begin{align}
  \FF = T^*[-1]F \quad \Lra \quad d_\KK = \{ S_{cl}, \cdot \} \equiv Q
\end{align}
where $Q = \sum_i \phi_i \dell{}{x^\dagger_i}$. Now in the case where nontrivial symmetries exist, we have nontrivial cocycles $R^i_\alpha x^\dagger_i \in H^{-1}(\KK^\bullet)$. Thus we introduce new variables in degree $-2$.\\

Let $d_1$ be the number of nontrivial Noether identities/symmetries. Namely it is the dimension of $\gf \in \widetilde{\gf} = \tf \oplus \gf$. Thus we introduce $c^\dagger_\alpha \in \Ci(\RR^{d_1}[-2])$ and set $d_\KK c^\dagger_\alpha = R^i_\alpha x^\dagger_i$ such that by pure construction $d_\KK^2 = 0$. Thus we define a bew complex
\begin{align}
  \KT^{(1)} :&= \Ci(F) \otimes \Ci(V[-1]) \otimes \Ci(\RR^{d_1}[-2]) \\
  &\simeq \Ci(T^*[-1]F \times \RR^{d_1}[-2])
\end{align}
Now if th Noether identities are all independent, i.e. if the symmetries are not reducible which means that $\rho \colon \gf \lra \VF(F)$ is injective, we have
\begin{equation}
  H^\circ(\KT^{(1)}) \simeq \Ci(F)/I_S, \quad \quad H^{-i}(\KT^{(1)}) = 0 \ \ \forall i > 0
\end{equation}
Now it could happen that there exist functions $r^\alpha_\beta \in \Ci(F)$ such that $r^\alpha_\beta R^i_\alpha = 0 \ \forall i$, namely relations among the symmetries. Thus there would exist a nontrivial cocycle $r^\alpha_\beta c^\dagger_\alpha \in H^{(-2)}(\KT^{(1)})$. Now we could repeat the procedure, adding $c^{(2)\dagger}_\beta \in \Ci(\RR^{d_2}[-3])$ and setting $d_2$ as the number of nontrivial relations such that $r^\alpha_\beta R^i_\alpha = 0$. This procedure can be inductively repeated leading us to
\begin{align}
  \KT^{(\infty)} :&= \Ci\left(T^*[-1]F \times \bigtimes_{k = 1}^\infty \RR^{d_k}[-k-1] \right) \\
  H^\circ(\KT^{(\infty)}) &\simeq \Ci(F)/I_S, \quad \quad H^{-i}(\KT^{(\infty)}) = 0 \ \ \forall i > 0
\end{align}
This is called the \textbf{Koszul-Tate resolution} of $\Ci(F)/I_S$ and $d_\KK$ is seen as the cohomological vector field on $T^*[-1]F \times \bigtimes_{k = 1}^\infty \RR^{d_k}[-k-1]$.\\

The following is due to Batalin and Vilkovisky:\\
We can adjoin coordinates $c^{(k)\alpha}$ for every $c^{(k)\dagger}_\alpha$ that we have from the $\KT$ construction where $-|c^{(k)\alpha}| = |c^{(k)\dagger}_\alpha| + 1$. In other words one looks at
\begin{equation}
  BV^\bullet \Ci\left(T^*[-1]\left(F \times \bigtimes_{k = 1}^\infty \RR^{d_2}[-k-1]\right)\right)
\end{equation}
Now there exists a canonical symplectic form $\Omega_{BV}$.\\

Our next step is to reconstruct the "BV package". We start by looking at
\begin{equation}
  d_\KK x^\dagger_i = \{ S_{cl}, \cdot \} \equiv Q_0
\end{equation}
where we set $S_{cl} = S_0$. Now extend $S_0 \lmap S_1 := S_0 + x^\dagger_i R^i_\alpha c^\alpha$ and set $Q_1 := \{ S_1, \cdot \}$ such that $Q_1 c^\dagger_\alpha = d_\KK c^\dagger_\alpha \equiv R^i_\alpha x^\dagger_i$. Now we can calculate

\begin{align}
  Q_1 x^i &= \{ S_1, x^i \} = \pm \frac{\delta}{\delta x^\dagger_k} ( S_0 + x^\dagger_j R^j_\alpha c^\alpha) \frac{\delta}{\delta x^k} x^i \\
  &= R^i_\alpha c^\alpha = c^\alpha V_\alpha(x^i)
\end{align}

\begin{ex}
  Show that $\{S_0, S_1\} = 0$ iff $\{R^i_\alpha\}$ represents a local symmetry. Also show that $\{S_1, S_1\} = 0$.
\end{ex}

In order to really reproduce the Chevally-Eilenberg cohomology, we need to further extend by

\begin{equation}
  S_2 = S_1 + \frac{1}{2} c^{(1)\dagger}_\alpha + f^\alpha_{\beta\gamma} c^\beta c^\gamma
\end{equation}

such that

\begin{equation}
  [V_\beta, V_\alpha] = f^\gamma{\beta\alpha} V_\gamma, \quad \quad f^\gamma_{\beta\alpha} = f^\gamma_{\beta\alpha} (x) \in \Ci(F)
\end{equation}

No generally both $R^i_\alpha$ and the $f^\alpha_{\beta\gamma}$ are functions on $F$. So it is \textbf{not} guaranteed that $\{S_2, S_2\} = 0$ and thus $Q_2 := \{S_2, \cdot\}$ is not necessarily a differential. The following theorem provides the necessary information to fix such problems:

\begin{theo}(Batalin-Vilkovisky)
  $S_2$ can be extended by terms of higher degree in $c^{(k) \dagger}_\alpha$ and $c^{(k) \alpha}$ to a function $S_\infty \in BV^\bullet$ such that $\{S_\infty, S_\infty\} = 0$ satisfies the \emph{Classical Master Equation} \eqref{ClassicalMasterEquation}, i.e. $Q_\infty := \{S_\infty, \cdot \}$ is a differential and $\left(T^*[-1]\left(F \times \bigtimes_{k = 1}^\infty \RR^{d_k}[-k-1]\right), \Omega_{BV}, S_\infty\right)$ is a classical BV theory.
\begin{proof}
  This proof is a sketch but captures the main points. The result stems from cohomological perturbation theory where one observes that if for $S_n$, $\{S_n, S_n\} = 0$ one also has $d_\KK \{S_n, S_n\} = 0$. Then since the Koszul complex has vanishing cohomology, there exists $f_{n+1}$ such that $\{S_n, S_n\} = d_\KK f_{n+1}$.
\end{proof}
\end{theo}

\begin{ex}
  Show that if $\{V_\alpha\}$ comes from an injective Lie algebra action, then one obtains $(T^*[-1](F \times \gf[-1]))$ with the BV-BRST data.
\end{ex}

Now the BV complex as constructed above achieves two main things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It localises to $\Crit(S)$ by means of the Koszul-Tate construction.
  \item It looks at invariants over $\Crit(S)^{\gf}$. More generally than a Lie algebra, $\gf$ is a subset of symmetries which will be involutive on $\Crit(S)$.
\end{enumerate}

Consider a complement $\gf$ of trivial symmetries $\tf$ inside all symmetries $\widetilde{\gf}$ (for a function $S_{cl} \equiv S_0 \colon F \lra \RR$). We know that $\gf$ is a subalgebra "on shell", i.e. on $\Crit(S)$. Thus we construct $\KT^{(\infty)}$ such that $H^0(\KT^{(\infty)}) \simeq \Ci(\Crit(S))$ and use it as a $\gf$-module which means looking at the Chevally-Eilenberg complex for the $\gf$ action on $\Ci(\Crit(S))$. This leads us to the following result:

\begin{theo}
  $(BV^\bullet, Q_\infty) \simeq C^\bullet_{CE}(\gf, H^\circ(\KT^{(\infty)}))$
\begin{proof}
  The proof is ommited since it is very technical and goes beyond the timescope of this course.
\end{proof}
\end{theo}

\begin{corollary}
  $H^\circ(BV^\bullet) \simeq \Ci(\Crit(S))^\gf \simeq \Ci(\Crit(S)/\gf)$
\end{corollary}

Now this is all the data we need for a physical theory. We have a critical locust, symmetries and a set of evolution equations. Summing up, our procedure goes as follows:\\

We have $F, S_0$ and a set of nontrivial symmetries $\gf$. Now if $\gf$ is a Lie algebra, we can look at pure BRST or more generally at $(T^*[-1]F_{BRST}, Q_{BV})$. If it isn't, we \emph{need} to work with $(T^*[-1]F_{BRST}, Q_{BV})$. From here on we will take the tuple $(\FF_{BV}, \Omega_{BV}, S_{BV}, Q_{BV})$ (where technically $Q$ is induced) and construct a classical BV QFT.
